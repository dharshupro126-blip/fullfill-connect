- AI Freshness Check: Utilize AI tool to analyze images of the listed food items and advise the user of freshness or spoilage.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary Green (#2ECC71) → sustainability, freshness (main action buttons, highlights).
- Warm Sand (#F4E1C6) → matches your "sandal" idea but more polished (background sections).
- Clean White (#FFFFFF) → clarity, space (cards, forms, base background).
- Charcoal Gray (#2D2D2D) → professional text color (headings, contrasts).
- Accent Yellow-Gold (#F1C40F) → energy, positivity (alerts, success states).
- Font pairing: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for headlines and short chunks of text, 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body text.
- Use clean, modern icons related to food, donation, and locations.
- Simple, intuitive layouts with clear calls to action for both donors and receivers.
